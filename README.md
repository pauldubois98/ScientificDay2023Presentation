# IEEE Scientific Day 2023 @ ISEP
## Presentation of TheraPanacea & PhD Project

Presentation for IEEE Scientific Day 2023 at ISEP engineering school.

### Abstract
Cancer is now the first cause of death in France (and this is also the case in most developed countries).
Over the course of the last century, radiotherapy has evolved from an experimental procedure to an established and recognized form of treatment.
This can be largely attributed to the significant reduction in the beam's toxicity, resulting in enhanced safety and efficacy of radiotherapy.

After a small introduction of TheraPanacea (company hosting my PhD), I will present what techniques I am working on to make the radiotherapy treatments more adaptive, reducing even further their risks and potential for adverse effects.
